            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I started my crochet journey in fifth grade, when a family member gifted me a beginner's knitting loom. After learning to use it and making a pretty sorry hat, I decided I wanted to learn traditional knitting with two needles. It proved to be very difficult for my 12 year old mind. I discovered crochet when I was looking for an easier way to learn knitting, seeing as it only uses one needle, or hook, instead of two. I was quickly more interested in it and would have my mom check out books of crochet patterns from the library every few weeks. Crochet is something that I have kept up with to this day, and I have completed many projects. I love seeing designs and clothing on social media and pop culture of the crochet comeback.</p>
            <p>To continue my journey I figured I better do some research and find out when and where my beloved craft originated.  Following my essential question, I began my quest looking through websites and a few crochet pattern blogs that I know and love.  This site will serve as a product of my findings and a bit of show and tell, so enjoy as the history unravels.</p>

                <h1>How has crochet evolved in fashion since it originated?</h1>
                <p>Crochet appeared in England For the first time in the 1820s.  The craft and technique was likely derived from two ancestors, shepherds knitting, which was popular in Denmark, and tambour embroidery, originating in China.    Crochet took on elements from both, using the intricate loops and weaving of shepherds knitting, but the hook of tambour embroidery.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-8">
                    <p>In Ireland, crochet became useful during the potato famine.  In a time of starvation and poverty, crochet was a promising way for young women to earn a living.  It made lacemaking much easier and affordable to the poor and working class.  Crocheted lace may have looked something like the image to the left.</p>

              <p>Moving forward throughout the 1800s, crochet struggled to lose the reputation of “cheap” and a “poor man’s craft”.  It finally gained popularity after Queen Victoria purchased crocheted lace from an Irish woman.  Queen Victoria had also learned to crochet after her purchase.</p>

                  <h3>20s and 30s</h3>
                  <p>Crochet started becoming more elaborate, and not just simple laces or doilies.  Intricate hats and elegant shawls began to be worn more frequently.   Crochet was used to create delicate embellishments to the backs of dresses.</p>

              <h3>War time</h3>
              <p>In between WWI and WWII, crochet began a decline.  There wasn’t too much time for hobbies and most were focused on contributing to the war effort.  However, crochet was used by a handful for cheap mending and producing goods for troops.</p>
              <h3>60s and 70s</h3>
              <p>The 60s and 70s gave way to a new generation of crochet in fashion.  Brighter colors were more accepted in fashion, offering crochet more options for creativity.  The craft also moved away from creating embellishments, and more toward producing whole clothing pieces.</p>
              <p>A now-popular design called the granny square made its first appearance and became a staple in 70s patterns, especially cardigans.  Hollywood and celebrities also began to take on crochet, along with the hippies who found crochet as a free and sustainable method of producing garments.</p>
              <h3>Modern Day</h3> 
              <p>Crochet has been seeing a major comeback lately, through pop culture and influencer platforms like TikTok.  Teens and the younger demographic have especially picked up the craft, along with high end brands such as Prada and Balenciaga.  Crochet has been featured on the runway several times in the past year.</p>
